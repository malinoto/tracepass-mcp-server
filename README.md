A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for
**[TracePass](https://www.tracepass.eu)** — the EU Digital Product
Passport platform. It lets AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, IDE agents)
manage products, Digital Product Passports, economic-operator parties,
and GS1 EPCIS 2.0 supply-chain events.

It speaks the full MCP protocol — **tools**, **resources**, **resource
templates**, and **prompts**.

## Two ways to use it

The same server core ships two ways:

1. **Hosted** — point your MCP client at `https://ai.tracepass.eu/mcp`.
   Nothing to install; always current.
2. **Local (npm)** — run `tracepass-mcp-server` via `npx`. The MCP
   client launches it as a subprocess and speaks MCP over stdio.

## Authentication

The server accepts **either** of TracePass's two v1 auth methods on the
same `Authorization: Bearer …` header — it forwards whatever you send to
the API, which decides. Pick the one that fits how you're connecting:

| | **API key** | **OAuth 2.0** |
|---|---|---|
| Best for | A single user, scripts, server-to-server | AI assistants / apps acting **on a user's behalf** |
| What you send | A static `tp_…` key as a Bearer token | A scoped access token obtained via the OAuth flow |
| Setup | Mint at **Developer → API Keys** | The user clicks **Connect** and approves scopes |
| Scope | All-or-nothing (the whole workspace) | Exactly the scopes the user granted; revocable |
| Works with | Hosted **and** local (npx) | Hosted endpoint only (needs a browser consent step) |

**Which should an AI assistant use?** If your MCP client supports OAuth
(Claude.ai, ChatGPT, and others), prefer **OAuth** — the user authorizes
the connection once on a TracePass consent screen, you never handle a
secret, and access is least-privilege and revocable. If your client only
takes a header/token, use an **API key**.

### OAuth 2.0 (recommended for hosted clients)

No config beyond pointing your client at the hosted endpoint — discovery
is automatic. On the first unauthenticated request the server returns a
`401` whose `WWW-Authenticate` header carries a `resource_metadata` URL
(RFC 9728) pointing at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, which
names the TracePass authorization server. The client runs the standard
**authorization-code flow with PKCE** (`/api/oauth/authorize` →
`/api/oauth/token`), the user approves scopes, and the client stores +
refreshes the token. If you distribute your own client, register an app
under **Developer → OAuth Apps** to get a `client_id`; many hosted
clients self-register via Dynamic Client Registration automatically.

Request only the scopes you need, e.g. `passports:read passports:write
offline_access`. Users manage connected apps (and revoke) under
**Developer → OAuth Apps → Connected Apps**.

### API key

Mint a `tp_…` key under **Developer → API Keys** and send it as a Bearer
token.

**Hosted:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tracepass": {
      "url": "https://ai.tracepass.eu/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer tp_YOUR_KEY" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Local (npx / stdio)** — the local subprocess can't do an interactive
OAuth consent step, so it's API-key only, via the `TRACEPASS_API_KEY` env:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tracepass": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "tracepass-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "TRACEPASS_API_KEY": "tp_YOUR_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optional env var: `TRACEPASS_BASE_URL` (defaults to
`https://app.tracepass.eu`) — point the tools at a different
TracePass deployment.

## Tools

The TracePass v1 API operations are grouped into **6 tools**.
Each takes an action enum plus action-specific arguments. The tools are:

- `tracepass_products` - manage the product catalogue (list, get, create, update products).
- `tracepass_passports` - manage Digital Product Passports (list, get, compliance check, create, suspend, archive, get QR), by id or by serial.
- `tracepass_passport_fields` - update a passport's category-specific data fields, by id or by serial.
- `tracepass_passport_parties` - set or remove a passport's economic-operator parties (manufacturer, importer, etc.).
- `tracepass_epcis` - export, capture, and query a passport's GS1 EPCIS 2.0 supply-chain events.
- `tracepass_templates` - list and get the DPP category regulatory field schemas.

Each tool's full action set:

| Tool | Actions |
|------|---------|
| `tracepass_products` | `list`, `get`, `create`, `update` |
| `tracepass_passports` | `list`, `get`, `get_by_serial`, `compliance`, `create`, `suspend`, `suspend_by_serial`, `archive`, `archive_by_serial`, `get_qr` |
| `tracepass_passport_fields` | `update`, `update_by_serial` |
| `tracepass_passport_parties` | `set`, `remove` |
| `tracepass_epcis` | `export`, `export_by_serial`, `capture`, `capture_job`, `query` |
| `tracepass_templates` | `list`, `get` |

The **`*_by_serial`** actions address a passport by the customer's own serial
number instead of its TracePass id. A serial is unique only *within a GTIN*, so
if the same serial exists under two GTINs in your account a serial-only call
returns **409 `ambiguous_serial`** — pass the optional `gtin` arg to disambiguate
(or use the by-id action). The same `gtin` disambiguator applies to every
`*_by_serial` action.

The **`tracepass_passports` `compliance`** action returns a three-tier
compliance verdict (`compliant` / `compliant_with_warnings` /
`incomplete`) with regulation-cited findings — missing required fields,
missing economic-operator parties, format issues, and per-category
conditional rules. Read-only; use it to gap-check a passport, fix the
cited gaps, then re-check.

### A note on writes

Some actions **cost money or are irreversible** — the server's tool
descriptions tell the model so:

- **`tracepass_passports` `create`** consumes a billable DPP slot on
  the account's plan. Over-quota creation incurs a per-passport
  overage charge; the tool surfaces a 402-style message and only
  proceeds with `args.confirmOverage: true` after the user agrees.
- **`tracepass_passports` `archive`** is irreversible — the public QR
  permanently 404s. Use `suspend` (reversible) when a change might be
  undone.
- **`tracepass_epcis` `capture` / `query`** require the paid EPCIS
  add-on; `export` is included on Starter plans and up.

## Resources

Read-only entity data you can attach as conversation context:

- `tracepass://products` — the product catalogue
- `tracepass://product/{id}` — one product
- `tracepass://passport/{id}` — one passport, full field detail
- `tracepass://passport/{id}/epcis` — a passport's EPCIS 2.0 events
- `tracepass://passport/{id}/compliance` — a passport's compliance verdict
- `tracepass://templates` — all 12 DPP category regulatory schemas
- `tracepass://template/{category}` — one category's full field schema

## Prompts

Reusable DPP workflows the client surfaces as slash-commands:

- `audit_passport` — review a passport for completeness and
  compliance readiness
- `onboard_product` — create a product and its first passport
- `explain_dpp_requirements` — explain what a category's compliant DPP
  must contain, and the regulation behind each field
- `compliance_gap_check` — produce a prioritised, regulation-cited list
  of what's blocking a passport's compliant publication
- `review_epcis_events` — summarise a passport's supply-chain trail

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build        # tsc -> dist/
npm run typecheck
npm test             # vitest
npm run lint
npm start            # run the hosted HTTP service locally (:8080)
npm run start:stdio  # run the stdio server locally
```

The hosted service is a plain Node HTTP server (`dist/http.js`),
stateless — each request carries its own API key and builds a fresh
MCP session. It is containerised via the `Dockerfile` and deployed to
Hetzner; see `tracepass-environment/docker-mcp.yml`.
